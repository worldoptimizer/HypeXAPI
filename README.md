The xAPI is a specification for how learning experiences can be shared and tracked across different platforms. It was created by a consortium of companies and organizations, including Adobe, Microsoft, and the US Department of Defense. The xAPI has many benefits, including the ability to track learning across different devices and platforms, and to create custom reports. The xAPI is also flexible, and can be used to track any type of learning experience, from formal courses to informal learning experiences.

The xapiwrapper is a library that allows developers to interface with the xAPI. It provides a simple, easy-to-use interface for developers to create xAPI-compliant applications. The xapiwrapper is open source, and is available for use on GitHub.

Tumult Hype is a powerful, yet easy-to-use, animation tool for creating interactive, animated web content. Tumult Hype is used by designers and developers to create animations, games, and other interactive content. The Tumult Hype community is large and active, and there are many resources available to help users get the most out of the tool. Tumult Hype is a versatile tool that can be used to create a wide variety of animated content.

The HypeXAPI project brings Tumult Hype and the XAPI together by using a live data store (actors, verbs, objects, etc.) and integrating Hype custom data into it. This allows for the tracking of Hype-based learning experiences across different platforms. The HypeXAPI also provides a GUI for exporting Hype-based content as an XAPI-compliant package.
